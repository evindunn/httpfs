# D7: Verification and Validation
###### tags: `deliverables`

## Description
HttpFs addresses the problem of the lack of a simple, fast, and secure network filesystem. This problem plagues developers and IT administrators who need a filesystem over a network. 

The current solution, NFS, was originally developed in the 1980s. It is overused and has no viable alternative. HttpFs solves this problem. It is an easy-to-setup remote storage solution that is built for developers and IT administrators. 

HttpFs is a network filesystem that is easy-to-use, like NFS, but, unlike NFS, is also fast and secure. Httpfs provides easily-configurable options for API key authentication and SSL/TLS. To make configuration even easier, HttpFs also includes utilities for generating SSL/TLS certificates and API keys.

## Verification

### Unit Test
**Framework**: pytest with pytest-coverage and pytest-mock plugins
**Location**: [tests/unit](https://github.com/httpfs/httpfs/tree/master/tests/unit)
**Mock Object Example**: Our tests for HttpFsClient make extensive use of mock objects and methods. [test_constructor_with_ssl()](https://github.com/httpfs/httpfs/blob/ed3f3523fa90984c4367dccefc1b3100afc681c6/tests/unit/client/test_HttpFsClient.py#L42) creates a mock object that emulates the existence of a file, "test-file.crt". Almost all other methods in  [test_HttpFsClient.py](https://github.com/httpfs/httpfs/blob/master/tests/test_HttpFsClient.py) use also mock methods to emulate the response received by the client from an HttpFsServer.

### Integration Test
**Framework**: pytest with pytest-coverage and pytest-mock plugins
**Location**: [tests/integration](https://github.com/httpfs/httpfs/tree/master/tests/integration)
**Example**: [tests/integration/test_ClientCreds.py](https://github.com/httpfs/httpfs/tree/master/tests/integration/test_ClientCreds.py) tests that three modules interact with each other properly:
- The HttpFs CLI is run to make sure it can successfully generate API keys using methods from the CredStore class.
- A TextCredStore is instantiated, making sure the CLI has properly populated the TextCredStore's file
- An HttpFsClient is instantiated with a reference to the TextCredStore; A mock request is made, making sure the generated API key is properly sent along with the client's request

### Acceptance Test
**Framework**: Linux bash script
**Location**:  [tests/acceptance.sh](https://github.com/httpfs/httpfs/blob/master/tests/acceptance.sh)
**Example**: [acceptance.sh](https://github.com/httpfs/httpfs/blob/master/tests/acceptance.sh) automatically creates an HttpFs mount and writes 5MiB of data, 1KiB at a time. The test measures write speed via the Linux command `dd`. With our non-functional requirement of speed comparible to NFS, the first iteration of HttpFs is a good start at 520 KiB/s.

## Validation

### Script

#### Greetings:

- Talk about the interviewee to confirm what you already know about them.
- Remind the interviewee of the original problem that our product’s soul purpose is to solve.

#### Demo:

At this point the demo should be properly introduced to the interviewee by stating the name of the product and how it is a solution to the interviewee’s original problem. Note that this is an interactive demo as the complex nature of productive would be too much to have the interviewee interact with the product without us guiding them.

**Running HttpFs steps (with docker)**:
- Create and activate local environment for HttpFs
- Download the docker compose file from the HttpFs repository
- Run docker compose command to start the server
- Repeat for server/client setup

**Running HttpFs steps(without docker)**:
- Create and activate local environment for HttpFs
- Generate an API key
- Create config.yaml file that has contents matching the API key we created
- Generate TLS certificates
- Start the server using TlS key/certification
- Start the client using the certification we obtained from the server

#### Tasks:
- Try and open a file
- Try and upload a file to the server
- Showcase setting up a HttpfsServer
- Showcase registering a new HttpFsClient to the HtppfsServer.
- Showcase interaction between what client and server using the following tasks:
    - Touching a file on the server from the server
    - Opening the file from the server in Vim through the client
    - Deleting the file from the server through the client
    - Displaying the file system statistics for the server through the client (cmd: `statfs`)
    - Checking that the server-client communication is encrypted
- Check that you are in the default directory (/mnt/httpfs/client for client, /mnt/httpfs/server for server) by using the 'ls' command
- Ensure that we use the cerification from the server on the client side
- Check that the files match on both the server and client side
- Check that adding a file to the client also adds that file to the server
- Check that the same file has the same contents on both the server and the client

### Results:

#### Interview 1:

**Conducted by**: Jared Cox 
**Interviewed**: Braeden Shaw, Informatics/Bioengineering Major 
**When**: 2020-04-22
**Key Insights**: 
- User liked how the file storage system functioned between the server and client
- User thought that the pathing done by HttpFs made it easier to find files
- Demonstrations of various tasks that can be done with HttpFs helped the user’s understanding
- While the user liked the product, they are currently not inclined to use it because they don’t see a need for the file storage space

**Tasks**:
- Connecting to the server both with and without the docker went well
- Showcasing of features such as the interactions between the server and client allowed the user to understand the product better
- We checked that the files matched on the server and client, which demonstrated how HttpFs updates both ends
- Had the user add a file to the client and showed where that file would be located on the server

**Representative quotes**: 
**Q**: What are your impressions on the look and feel of HttpFs? 
**A**: “I think that HttpFs does a fair job at what it is trying to accomplish. The UI is similar enough to many other filesystems, so that made it easier to use.”

**Q:** How does this look compare to NFS?
**A:** "It looks and feels rather similar. Both products accomplish the same task of server-client file storage."

**Q**: How likely are you to use our product in its current state?
**A**: “I think I would consider using HttpFs if I had more of a need for file storage. If that changes in the future, I might consider using it in the future, but not for now.”

**Q**: What feature impressed you the most?
**A**: “Accessing the files on the server was surprisingly easy compared to what I’d expected.”

**Q**: On a Scale from 1 to 10 How efficient are our write speeds?
**A**: "5, overall they didn't impress me compared to NFS."

**Q**: On the same scale, how easy was it to set up our product? What about compared to competition?
**A**: "7, the steps were somewhat easy to follow besides trying to initally set up the server."

**Q** On the same scale, how intuitive is our design to use?
**A**: "9, the files on the client match the server in their contents and directory, which makes plenty of sense."

**Assessment**
After conducting the user evaluation with Braeden Shaw, it is clear that our product is effective at the role it is trying to fulfill as a viable alternative to NFS. While this user might not have a need for storing files externally themself, they were able to see the value that HttpFs could bring to a user looking for a product that can do this.

 


#### Interview 2:

**Conducted by:** Darius Dumel
**Interviewee:** Iain Donnelly, Electrical Engineer, Raytheon
**When:** 2020-04-25
**Key Insights:**

- Set up of server is a little clunky but could be a lot worse thanks to documentation
- Write speeds are subpar
- Minimal GUI would enhance the look and feel.
**Representative Quotes:**
**Q:** What are your impressions on the look and feel of HttpFs?
**A:** “Im not impressed if that is what you are asking. It’s all in the command line. I think for what it is though, it is fine for it to have little to no GUI elements”

**Q:** How does this look compare to NFS?
**A:** “pretty much the same. They are both command line programs so other than the set up they look the same”

**Q:** On a scale from 1 to 10 how efficient are out write speeds?
**A:** “I’d say 3? Its workable but definitely not preferred”

**Q:** On the same scale how easy was the set up?
**A:** “5. It’s a little clunky but the documentation on the repo is extremely easy to follow”

**Q:** On the same scale, how intuitive were the commands used in the demo?
**A:** “I’d give it a 9… its mostly just bash commands, right?”

**Q:** How likely are you to use our product in its current state?
**A:** “Ah I'd have to say not likely. NFS has the support I would need and, this doesn’t”

**Q:** “What features impressed you the most?”
**A:** I like that this can work on both linux and windows after setting up. That’s nice”

**Assessment:**

Based on the user evaluation with Iain Donnelly, it is apparent that our product has matched the look and feel of our competition with room to improve upon that by adding GUI elements. Though we have been working on improving write speeds between our clients and server, we will have to get to the same consistency and speed as our competitors if we are to get users to use our product. Currently our only pro over the competition is cross platform support between Windows and Linux machines.


#### Interview 3:
**Conducted by**: Jared Weinberger 
**Interviewed**: Paul Gellai, Computer Science Major 
**When**: 2020-04-22
**Key Insights**: 
- User had an overall horrible experience attempting to set up the server according to our instructions.
- User found our tool difficult (and in some cases impossible) set up, administrate, and use.

**Tasks**:
- The user could not set up the client for HttpFs. No further tasks could be performed.

**Representative quotes**: 
**Q**: How likely are you to use our product in its current state?
**A**: “I would legitemately never use this software as it is right now.”

**Q:** How does this look compare to NFS?
**A:** "Well NFS actually _functions_, and this does not, so this shouldn't even be considered in comparison to NFS."


**Q**: On the same scale, how easy was it to set up our product? What about compared to competition?
**A**: "I couldn't set it up."

**Assessment**
After conducting the user evaluation with Paul Gellai, we can see that it can be difficult, even for some experienced system administrators, to set up and run our server. This could make it inviable for some users.

### Reflections:

- What features were best received?
    - The filesystem ran fast and securely for both the server and client side.
- How easy is HttpFs to use?
    - For most that are already familar with filesystems like NFS, HttpFs is easy to get started and access.
- Were the tasks able to be completed? If not, which tasks had difficulties?
    - All of the tasks were completed successfully by our interviewees with the exception of Paul Gellai. However, some were more difficult than others, such as initially setting up the server.
- What tasks were the most difficult? Least difficult?
    - Setting up the server seemed to be the area that the majority of the users had the most problems with. The least difficult part appeared to be acessing the files after the server was set up.
- Did we meet our initial value proposition?
    - Our initial value proposition was a network filesystem similar to NFS but also fast and secure. Based on user feedback, we have met this value proposition.
- What can be changed about the design?
    - One user suggested that we could add GUI elements to our design to make our product easier to use.
- Did the users have issues following the script?
    - Most of the users reported no problems while trying to follow our outline.
- Was the server and client easy to navigate for the user?
    - Navigation of both the server and the client was easy after we showcased how some of these procedures work. For example, we showcased accessing, modifying, and deleting files before the user tried these things, which made it more easy for our users to follow.
- Did the user run into any technical difficulties?
    - Technical difficulties were encountered during setup by some users.
