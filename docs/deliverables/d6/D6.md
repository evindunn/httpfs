# D6: Implementation 2

## Introduction

HttpFs addresses the problem of the lack of a simple, fast, and secure network filesystem. This problem plagues developers and IT administrators who need a filesystem over a network. 

The current solution, NFS, was originally developed in the 1980s. It is overused and has no viable alternative. HttpFs solves this problem. It is an easy-to-setup remote storage solution that is built for developers and IT administrators.

HttpFs is a network filesystem that is easy-to-use, like NFS, but, unlike NFS, is also fast and secure. Httpfs provides easily-configurable options for API key authentication and SSL/TLS. To make configuration even easier, HttpFs also includes utilities for generating SSL/TLS certificates and API keys.

## Code Quality

To make sure all code submitted to the HttpFs master branch was bug free and to standard our team used pull requests through GitHub to add to the branch. Using this method ensured that all code was at least reviewed and approved by a seperate team member working on the code base.

Another practice we incorporated to manage code quality was trying to focus on following Python's best practices and leverage the readability of the Python language. We used `pylint` for many parts of developmentWe also set up a [GitHub action](https://github.com/httpfs/httpfs#httpfs) to run PyLint on every commit to the master branch of our repository. Although our score is less than ideal we now have a metric for further refactoring and a standardized way to help ensure code quality.

As far as the structure to our code we made sure to keep our overall app design as simple as possible while minimizing the amount of coupling between classes. This involved using interfaces where ever possible such as in credential storage and our core fuse operations.

## Lessons Learned

1. **When to setup definitive code quality standards:** <br/> We only set up pylint very recently, so it doesn't fully agree with the way that our project was developed. We have learned through the development of HttpFs that it is important to have clear coding standards early on, and `pylint` is an excellent tool to help with that.

2. **How to use libraries to solve problems effeciently:** <br/> Throughout our development on HttpFs we have had issues with the read and write speeds from clients to the server. After trying multiple strategies to improve these speeds we only were able to get the write speeds to < 1MB/s. There arose the possibility that we might have to either accept a dissapointing speed cap on our data transmissions or that we would need to write our own very complicated piece of code to fix the problem. Then we came accross the C-based JSON parser and loader called `ujson`. This increased our write speeds by 300% and ended our dilemma.

3. **How to properly manage pull requests:** <br/> At first, we were a lot more unorganized when it came to our GitHub pull requests, but we improved our organization of the pull requests by increasing the level of communication across the team. We learned the value of pull requests as our codebase kept growing and found them necessary to keep track of who did what and why as well as maintaining code quality.

4. **Cohesive Documentation:** <br/> When we first started to implement our project, we didn't document or comment code as often as we felt we should have. This led to issues when we had to revisit our code, so we have since made clear documentation a higher priority.
