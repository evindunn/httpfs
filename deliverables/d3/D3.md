# D3 - Analysis

### System Description
Httpfs addresses the problem of the lack of a simple, fast, and secure network
filesystem. This problem affects developers and IT administrators, the
impact of which is that NFS, originally developed in the 1980s, is overused
with no viable alternative. For developers and IT administrators who need
an easy-to-set-up remote storage solution, Httpfs is a network filesystem that
is easy-to-use, like NFS, but is also fast, secure, and cross-platform.
Httpfs makes it easy to access your data in the cloud.

Httpfs includes an easy-to-set-up storage **server** component. The server
parses *JSON requests* <u>sent from</u> the **client** component that correspond to
*filesystem actions*. The Httpfs **server** then <u>translates</u> these requests
into **Fuse**-based *filesystem actions*, executes those actions, and sends the
*results as JSON* back to the **client**.
To support secure communication, the Httpfs server automatically
encrypts traffic via TLS, either by generating *certificate pairs* or accepting
a pre-generated pair in its *configuration* file.

On Windows systems, the Httpfs **client** appears as a network drive in File Explorer.
On Unix-based systems, the **client** is packaged with the `mount` command. The Httpfs
**client** <u>intercepts</u> native filesystem commands and translates them into *JSON*,
which is compact and fast for data transfer over HTTP. The **client** then
<u>sends</u> that *JSON* to the Httpfs **server** and awaits a *response*,
which is eventually returned to the user in a way that corresponds to their operating system.

In order to support access control, the Httpfs **server** <u>stores</u> a list of API keys
in its *configuration*. Each Httpfs **client** has a corresponding key in its
*configuration*. On every *request* from an Httpfs **client**, the Httpfs server
ensures that a valid API key is included. In this way, only authorized access to the
Httpfs **server** is permitted.
