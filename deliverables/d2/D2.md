### Problem Statement

|                        |                                                                             |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The problem of         | **a simple, fast, secure network filesystem**                               |
| affects                | **developers and IT administrators**                                        |
| the impact of which is | **NFS, originally developed in the '80s, is over-used with no alternative** |

### Product Position Statement

|             |                                                     |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| For         | **developers and IT admins**                        |
| Who         | **need an easy-to-set-up, remote storage solution** |
| Httpfs      | **is a network filesystem**                         |
| That        | **is easy-to-use, like NFS**                        |
| Unlike      | **NFS**                                             |
| Our product | **fast, secure, and cross-platform**                |

### Value Proposition

**Value Proposition:** Httpfs is network storage that allows developers and
IT administrators to easily set up and administer a fast and secure remote
filesystem.

**Consumer segment:** Developers who want decoupled storage for applications,
and IT administrators looking to set up a modern alternative to NFS.

## Stakeholders

### Software Developers (Evin Dunn, Darius Dumel, Jared Cox, Jared Wienbuerger )

Responsible for the developement of the project as a whole. Devs will be testing the software as it is developed and edit software as per request of requirements and the client

### Users - IT software developers, DevOps, engineering/computer science students

Users will be able to test and use release versions of the software. The hope is that these Users will give valuable feed back that the software devoplement team can make the product as user friendly as possible.

### Competitors - NFS, Samba, Google Drive

Server-Client file transfer software that we will base our own product off of. We will also attempt to adress issues within competitor's software to make ours stand out.

## Functional Requirements (features)

1. Easy-to-set-up storage server component
2. Easy-to-use Windows network drive client, which appears in File Explorer
3. HTTPS-based encryption of traffic
4. Use of command line commands to be able to communitcate to server
5. Client-server authentication via an API key, server-side storage and lookup of API keys
6. Easy-to-use mount client, which is indistinguishable from a local directory on Unix systems
7. the abblity to access the server through multiple access points without conflicts

## Non-functional Requirements

1. **Usablity** - 80% of users are able to easibly access the server using commands and interface provided by our software
2. **Speed** - 80% of users report no percivable slowdown when accessing server side files with our software.
3. **Security** - 100% of unauthenticated client requests are rejected
4. **Performance** - 90% of users report little to none issues being disconnected to the server due to issues with our mount. The mount will also load in resonable chunks of data for each file so that local memory space is not overloaded
5. **Readablity** - Users will be able to understand any information requested from the mount commands using proir knowledge or help provided by our README or commented code.

## MVP

Disigning a minimum viable product for a Http file system mount will require basic functionality that satisfies our listed requirements. To have both an easy to set up server storage and an easy to mount client we will create a script of some kind. This script will load the necessary files needed to communcicate from client to server and vice versa. This will be validated by conducting tests within the developement team and select testers to make sure the server and mount are easy to set up. To ensure HTTPS encryption, we will make sure all commands call upon https protocols. To validate this we will set up tests watching for any lost or exposed data within our client mount calls to the server. Another step to having a MVP is having a command line interface aswell as a file explorer like gui to traverse server files. the command line interface will be done through python calls called in the the users command line. for the file explorer interface we will implement open source resources to mount the server to the users Unix system file explorer.

#### Use Cases

![Use cases](./use-case.png)

##### Description #1

1. **Brief Description:** Change the port that Httpfs is using
2. **Actor Description:** An IT administrator
3. **Pre-conditions**:
    - Httpfs is installed
    - The administrator has admin access to the server
4. **Basic Flow**:
    1. The use case begins when an IT administrator wants to change the port
        that Httpfs is running on
    2. The administrator opens `/etc/httpfs/httpfs.yml`
    3. The administrator finds the line which contains the `port:` key
    4. The administrator updates the port to a valid integer value
    5. The administrator restarts Httpfs: `systemctl restart httpfs`
    6. The use case ends.
5. **Alternative Flows**:
    - If, in step 4, the administrator provides an invalid port value
        5. Httpfs reports a failure to systemd and refuses to start after
        `systemctl restart httpfs` is executed
        6. The use case ends.
6. **Post-conditions**:
    - **Success:** Httpfs is now running on the desired port
    - **Failure:** Httpfs is stopped and the systemd log shows an error

##### Description #2

1. **Brief Description:** Delete a file in directory
2. **Actor Description:** User
3. **Pre-conditions**:
    - Httpfs is installed
4. **Basic Flow**:
    1. The user opens httpFS command line
    2. The user invokes the call `rm()` with the file path in its parameters
    3. The system intercepts call and packs it into the `unlink()` function
    4. The system will call the `rm()` on the server to remove the file.
    5. The use case ends.
5. **Alternative Flows**:
    - The file or directory does not exist.
        1. system notifies user that the file or directory does not exist
    - The User does not have persmission to delete file
        1. the system notifies user that they do not have permission to delete file.
7. **Post-conditions**:
    - **Success:** file is deleted from server
    - **Failure:** file is not deleted from server and user is notified of failure

##### Description #3

1. **Brief Description:** Lists all files in a directory
2. **Actor Description:** User
3. **Pre-conditions**:
    - Httpfs is installed
    - The User has access to the server
4. **Basic Flow**:
    1. The user opens httpFS command line
    2. The user invokes `ls()` with the directory in its parameters
    3. The system intercepts call and invokes `listdir()`
    4. The system lists the files and folders in the directory
    5. The use case ends.
5. **Alternative Flows**:
    - The direcoty does not exist.
        1. The system reports the failed call to the user.
7. **Post-conditions**:
    - **Success:** User recieves a list of the files and folders in a directory
    - **Failure:** Httpfs is stopped and the systemd log shows an error

##### Description #4

1. **Brief Description:** Set up an API key for an Httpfs client
2. **Actor Description:** An IT administrator
3. **Pre-conditions**:
    - Httpfs is installed
    - The administrator has admin access to the server
4. **Basic Flow**:
    1. The use case begins when an IT administrator wants to add a client
        that can interact with an Httpfs server
    2. The administrator uses httpfs to generate a new API key: `httpfs gen-key`
    4. The administrator opens `/etc/httpfs/httpfs.yml`
    5. The administrator finds the line which contains the `clients:` key
    6. The administrator adds an API key to the `clients` list:
        ```
        clients:
            - 2a509c04b0efa8db8cb8f752cf6203a3
        ...
        ```
    7. The administrator restarts Httpfs: `systemctl restart httpfs`
    8. The system scans the `clients` list, storing API keys to check against client requests
    9. The use case ends.
5. **Alternative Flows**: **[None]**
6. **Post-conditions**:
    - **Success:** Httpfs is now running with the new API key list
    - **Failure:** Httpfs is stopped and the systemd log shows an error
